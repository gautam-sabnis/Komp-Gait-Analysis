Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 3 of /Users/sabnig/Lab-Projects/Analysis/Komp-Gait-Analysis/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
Plots/komp-exp1.pdf
Plots/komp-exp2.pdf
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
